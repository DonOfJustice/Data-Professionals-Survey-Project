# Data-Professionals-Survey-Project
In this project, I analyse dataset gotten from AlexTheAnalyst's github by cleaning the raw data on Microsoft SQL Server and proceeding to provide insights on the data via Microsoft PowerBI.
The data set is the result of a survey administered on 630 unique respondents who work in at least one field of data science/engineering.
From the dataset, we can find out how happy data professionals are with their work as well as other minor information such as the favourite programming languages of data professionals.
