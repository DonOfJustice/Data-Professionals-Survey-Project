# Data-Professionals-Survey-Project
In this project, I analyse dataset gotten from AlexTheAnalyst's github by cleaning the raw data on Microsoft SQL Server and proceeding to provide insights on the data via Microsoft PowerBI.

The data set is the result of a survey administered on 630 unique respondents who work in at least one field of data science/engineering.
From the dataset, we can find out how happy data professionals are with their work as well as other minor information such as the favourite programming languages of data professionals.

**The dataset can be gotten [here](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/Power-BI/blob/main/Power%20BI%20-%20Final%20Project.xlsx) and my SQL codes can be seen [here](https://github.com/DonOfJustice/Data-Professionals-Survey-Project/blob/main/data%20professionals%20survey%20SQL%20codes.sql).** 

**My Visualization on PowerBI can be seen and explored [here](https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/069d80b1-ccc2-4d17-864e-74de366405c1/ReportSection)**

## A few insights from the analysis

- On a scale of 0-10, professionals expressed a cummulative avegarage score of 5.74 when asked how happy they were with work-life balance. They however expressed displeasure when asked how happy they were with their salaries.

- On the average, data scientists earn more annually than any other data professional.

- Python seems to be the most preferred programming language amongst data professionals as about 400 respondents out of 630 opted for python as their favorite language.
